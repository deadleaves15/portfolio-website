          <p>There is the best of this, the best of that, and then you have the metaliest metal bands forged by lyrical blacksmiths deep down in the mines of heavy metal. The metaliest, you know, metal. Not as in the genre-est of metal, but the bands that sing of metal the word or the scientific elements while slaying the genre of heavy metal. These metal bands have metal on the mind, metal plates in their heads, and a tendency towards a high iron diet.</p>
